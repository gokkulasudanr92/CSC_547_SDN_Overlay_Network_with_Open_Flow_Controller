\section{Abstract}
%{The infrastructure basically contains compute, storage and networking hardware. ---- Can we add HPC compute nodes as well}
Apache Virtual Computing Lab (VCL) is an open-source system used to dynamically provision and broker remote access to a dedicated compute environment for an end-user \cite{vcl}\cite{schaffer2009ncsu}. Setting up and maintaining VCL for a large institution like NCSU, requires large scale infrastructure. The infrastructure basically contains compute, storage and networking hardware. Managing a large virtual environment at scale grows in complexity as demand for VCL services increase. Software-defined networking (SDN) helps network administrators to easily configure networking devices in a dynamic environment, where requirements are changed on a regular basis. Currently, VCL uses Linux bridges over Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to communicate between VMs. The project aims to replace this infrastructure and use Open vSwitch(OVS) instead. With OVS running on all networking devices, it will be possible to control them using a SDN controller. This will ease the process of configuring multiple networking devices.

\section{Introduction}
Apache Virtual Computing Lab (VCL) is a free and open source cloud computing platform which provides custom compute resources on demand to its users \cite{vcl}\cite{schaffer2009ncsu}. These compute resources are provisioned to users in a virtualized environment. Virtualized networks or overlay networks are networks built on top of another(physical or virtual) network. Currently, the VCL uses Linux bridges to connect the VMs to the host’s physical networks. This project aims to replace those bridges with Open vSwitches and create an overlay network.

More about Apache VCL can be found in appendix \ref{apachevcl}.

% The compute environment can vary according to the user's requirement. The VCL platform can accommodate requirements ranging from simple virtual machines to cluster of physical machines running HPC(high performance computing) applications. Using VCL a user can provision several types of computer resources such as bare-metal machines, VMs hosted on hypervisors and traditional lab computers.

% The VCL environment also provides a front-end to facilitate the users to make reservations for custom computer resources. 



\subsection{Problem Statement}

\textbf{\emph{To create an SDN Overlay Network on VCL Sanboxes using Open vSwitch.}}
\\
\\
The current VCL network architecture faces two major problems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item KVM hypervisors in the VCL infrastructure use linux bridges to connect to guest virtual machines. Use of linux bridges limits flexibility in network management. In particular, any new service on the linux bridges involves recompiling the bridge module.
    \item Further, in the current infrastructure, the "management" domain is restricted to a single KVM hypervisor. Virtual machines running on one KVM hypervisor form a local isolated network.
\end{enumerate}
  %stop writing need to upload who is this ?: This is Shravan.
  This project is aimed to modify this architecture by replacing the linux bridges with Open vSwitch bridges and interconnecting these bridges across multiple KVM hypervisors to improve manageability, configurability and flexibility of the VCL network.  

% This project involves configuring several KVM hypervisors within VCL to use Open vSwitch and VxLAN protocol to establish a SDN overlay network among the VCL nodes. 
% After establishing the overlay network, an openflow controller needs to be added to the SDN overlay. This provides a more complex control of the network. VCL sandboxes will be used to effectively establish a small VCL cluster running within the NCSU production VCL system.

% Currently, the KVM hypervisors are using Linux bridges to connect the VMs to the host’s physical networks. This project would replace those bridges with Open vSwitches.  Additionally, tunnels between the hypervisors would be created to establish a single private network for the project VCL cluster. After the private network has been created a single management node will be used to provision VMs on all the VCL sandboxes.

\subsection{Motivation}

In the present VCL environment, suppose a user wants to configure network for 10 VCL sandboxes (analogous to single tenant having VMs spanning across multiple data centers). The user will have to access each sandbox to manage or make changes to the network configuration. This is cumbersome and also takes a lot of time. An overlay network with a centralized controller provides a fine-grained control of the network. This results in a VMs-only virtual network across multiple sandboxes with a single management point. Such an overlay network enables cloud administrators to effectively manage mutliple VCL nodes to establish a small VCL cluster running within the NCSU production VCL system. 

\subsection{Issues}
% The networking of VCL sandboxes require 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Libvirt does not attempt to manage the openvswitch bridge interface. So, no iptables rules, IP addresses, or DHCP/DNS services are added to ovs bridges by libvirt. All of these services must be added to it manually. 
    \item VxLAN encapsulation increases the packet size. Since the MTU of the network is 1500, VxLAN packets get fragmented and ultimately dropped. Due to this, it is observed frequently that ssh packets originating from management node of the master destined to the slave host get dropped and the SSH connection fails.
    \item Every sandbox has a maximum of 4 VMs. The MAC \& IP addresses of these 4 VMs match the MAC \& IP addresses of VMs in another sandbox. Because of this, more than a combined total of 4 VMs can not be brought up on two sandboxes put together without changing the MAC addresses of VMs. IP addresses, however, can be assigned differently by running a single DHCP server but the MAC addresses will have to be modified. Modifying MAC addresses involve modifying the VMs XML source file, which is out of scope for this project.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To replace the Linux bridge with open vSwitch on KVM inside a VCL Sandbox 2.4.2. After the bridge has been replaced, VCL should be able to provision VMs on the hypervisor, as it did before changing to Open vSwitch. Also, the networking changes should be persistent across reboots.
    \\
    \textbf{Sub requirements:}
    \begin{enumerate}   
        \item Install OvS
        \item Destroy all active VMs in the sandbox
        \item Add new OvS bridges for "nat" and "private" network
        \item Destroy and undefine the previous "nat" and "private" network configuration
        \item Define and load OvS "nat" and "private" network configuration
        \item Change firewall rules to allow traffic on OvS brige
        \item Configures DHCP for "nat" and "private" network
        
    \end{enumerate}

    \item To replicate the environment mentioned above on another VCL sandbox. 
    \\
    \textbf{Sub requirements:}
    \begin{enumerate}   
        \item Re-do steps as mentioned in functional-requirement 1.
        \item Destroy the management node.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item To establish a tunnel between the sandboxes running Open VSwitch and setup a private network using either VxLan tunnelling protocol.

    \item The management node on one VCL sandbox (master) should be able to provision VMs on all such sandboxes (slaves) over the earlier described private network. For this, a single common DHCP server running on the master sandbox must be used to provide IP addresses to VMs on all sandboxes. Users must still be able to connect to a reserved VM on any sandbox, as they did before the tunnel was established.
    
    \item To reconfigure the VCL sandboxes to use a single NAT host, preferably on the master sandbox. Thus, users should be able to connect to VMs on either host. However, all connections should be made through the public IP of only one host.

    
    % After completing step 1, you will have a single sandbox working that is using
    % Open vSwitch.  So, what will be the other endpoint for the tunnel described in
    % step 2?  You need to move part of what you have in step 3 to before step 2
    % (the part about replicating the environment).
    
    % You will need to modify DHCP for the private network.
    
    % Also, note that at this point you should have replaced both bridges in the
    % sandboxes with Open vSwitches, but you are only establishing a tunnel for the
    % private network.

        
    \item To install a SDN controller on one of the sandboxes to orchestrate Open vSwitches on all the sandboxes and police the traffic over the private and nat networks.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item To analyze and mitigate known vulnerabilities and threats introduced by the migration to OvS.
        \item To analyze performance of the entire system after introducing SDN / OvS.
        \item To analyze scaling issues introduced by OvS and tunneling.
        \item To provide succinct documentation/scripts needed for a VCL administrator to replicate these setups without having to do additional research on what commands to run and how to configure things. 
    
    \end{enumerate}
    % Use of single NAT also limits scalability (port number / FDs). NAT host is overloaded, which might limit scalability
    % Possible solutions - Use load balancer in front of a NAT. Distributed NAT service.

\end{itemize}


\section{Design}

This section describes the design of the entire system. 
KVM hypervisors in the current VCL system use linux bridges to communicate to the virtual machines running on top of them. Replacing the linux bridge with an Open vSwitch has certain advantages and disadvantages. They are enumerated below:
\\

\noindent
\textbf{Advantages:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open vSwitch is highly programmable. Supports OpenFlow protocol.
    \item Enables flow routing. This provides greater flexibility in the number of match fields that can be defined for switching. 
    \item Specially designed for virtual environments. Supports all popular hypervisors including Xen and KVM. A migration to a different hypervisor does not involve changing the switching infrastructure
    \item Studies by Emmerich et.al. \cite{6968979} show that Open vSwitch offers better performance than native linux bridges
    \item Free and open-source
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{Disadvantages:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Traditional linux images come up with linux bridges pre-installed. Open vSwitch functionality has to be installed separately
    \item Libvirtd does not manage ovs bridges whereas it can manage linux bridges. Ovs bridges will have to be managed manually.
\end{enumerate}

At the cost of installing and configuring the bridges, OvS improves flexibility and manageability of a virtual environment. These are the reasons why an important design choice in the project was to replace the linux bridges with OvS bridges.


\subsection{VCL Sandbox}

Figure \ref{fig:vcllinux} shows the current sandbox architecture being realised with linux bridges.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{vcl_linux_sandbox}
\caption{VCL sandbox with Linux Bridge}
\label{fig:vcllinux}
\end{figure}

The sandboxes have one dedicated VM for managing other VMs. This VM is called the 'management node' uses the linux bridge to communicate with other VMs. The number of nodes that one management node can manage is limited to one host.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{vcl_ovs_sandbox}
\caption{VCL sandbox with Open vSwitch}
\label{fig:vclovs}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig:vclovs} the linux bridges replaced with Open vSwitch bridges. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{vxlan_sandboxes}
\caption{VxLan tunnel between two VCL Sandbox}
\label{fig:vclvxlan}
\end{figure}

The ovs bridges are interconnected through a VxLan tunnel \cite{mahalingam2012vxlan}. A second design choice has been to use a suitable tunneling protocol to interconnect OvS switches
Some of the differences between VxLan and Geneve tunneling protocols are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item VxLan is a widely accepted protocol for network virtualization. Most switch hardware vendors support VxLan. 
    \item Geneve protocol is widely believed to be next-generation tunneling protocol due the flexibility it offers. However, lack of multivendor support for the protocol restricts its use in all network scenarios
    
\end{enumerate}
Modern data centers include a mix of hypervisor-based virtual machines, bare-metal workloads, and network services. All these components must be able to efficiently process packets and participate in an encapsulation protocol. Due to hardware interoperability and standardization, VxLan is better suited for network virtualization in data center environments

VxLan adds 50 bytes of header to an IP packet. This adds an overhead on applications such as SSH and Telnet where smaller packets are transmitted at short intervals (such as for each key stroke). Since, the interconnections are between two hosts, ssh/telnet use cases are not relevant in the current scenario.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Connected_vcl_sandboxes}
\caption{VCL Cluster with a single SDN Controller}
\label{fig:vclconnected}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig:vclconnected} shows an SDN controller managing all the connected sandboxes. The SDN controller is only logically centralized whereas the controller process can run on any machine. Among the various controllers implementing the SDN concept, the choice to use Open Daylight is due to the following reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ODL is free and open source
    \item OpenDaylight project promises to standardize the northbound interface. This enables other controllers can leverage ODL to gain consistency across multiple vendors
    \item The implementation is enterprise ready. This has been seen in wide deployments of SDN systems with ODL controller such as CableLabs.
    \item ODL design is completely modular. It provides support for a wide range of services including NFV and IoT use cases.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Implementation}

This section describes implementation details of the project. 

\subsection{Installing OvS} \label{master_install_ovs}

OvS does not come pre-installed with stock Centos 7 machines and needs to be installed manually. There are many resources available online which provide step by step guide to install OvS. We followed one such article to configure OvS in our setup \cite{ovsinstall}. Appendix \ref{ovs_install}, provides details on step by step manual installation of OvS and using a script.

\noindent
There are three main functions which the script performs to install OvS \cite{ovs_script}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Install required packages for OvS: \textit{install\_ovs\_required\_packages()}
    \item Add user OvS: \textit{add\_new\_user("ovs")}
    \item Install OvS Packages: \textit{install\_ovs\_packages()}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Configuring OvS for master VCL Sandbox} \label{master_configure_vcl}
To configure Open vSwitch for a single VCL sandbox the following steps need to be followed: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Destroy the old "private" and "nat" bridge networks
    \item Create two new bridges for "private" as "ovsbr0" and "nat" as "ovsbr1"
    \item Create new OvS xml configuration file for each "private" and "nat" network
    \item Add new OvS bridge for both "private" and "nat" network
    \item Assign the network bridges IP 
    \item Define the new "private" and "nat" bridge network using the OvS xml configuration. 
    \item Start the new "private" and "nat" bridge network
    \item Change firewall rules for the new bridges (virbr0 $->$ ovsbr0 \& virbr1 $->$ ovsbr0)
    \item Configuring DHCP for master VCL Sandbox
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Define a new DHCP configuration for "nat" and "private" network
    \item Define a new DHCP hostfile for "nat" and "private" network
    \item Define a new DHCP additional hosts file for "nat" and "private" network
    \item Load the DHCP configuration for "nat" and "private" network
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Appendix \ref{ovs_one_sandbox}, provides details on step by step manual configuration of OvS for a single sandbox.

\subsection{Replicate the setup for slave sandbox} 
To replicate the setup in slave sandbox, all the steps in section \ref{master_install_ovs} and section \ref{master_configure_vcl}. The following things need to kept in mind while configuring the slave sandbox:
\begin{itemize}
    \item DHCP should not be configured. There steps in section \ref{master_configure_vcl}, till item number 8 need to be followed.
    \item IP address of ovsbr0 and ovsbr1 should be different from master sandbox OvS brige IP address.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Configuring VxLan tunnel}

VxLan tunnels need to be configured between the master and slave sandbox to create an overlay network. There are two tunnels which are created for "private" and "nat" network, through the public interface of master and slave sandbox. The following steps need to be followed to configure tunnels for the sandbox:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set up VxLan tunnel for "nat" network \cite{vxlan}.
    \item Set up VxLan tunnel for "private" network \cite{vxlan}.
    \item Add firewall rule in master to allow UDP packet at VxLan tunnel port from slave sandbox.
    \item Add firewall rule in slave to allow UDP packet at VxLan tunnel port from master sandbox.
    \item Change MTU size for all the interfaces to 1400.
\end{enumerate}
Appendix \ref{vxlan_config}, provides details on step by step manual configuring tunnel between master and slave sandbox.

\subsection{Adding slave as a virtual host}
The management node should be aware that it can provision VMs on another virtual host. To achieve this we need to add a virtual host using the VCL web interface. To add a virtual host the following steps need to be followed:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Login to VCL web interface (master VCL sandbox management node)
    \item Go to Manage Computers tab $->$ Add new computer $->$ Add details of the slave sandbox, details in figure \ref{fig:vclvirtualhost}
    \item Go to virtual host tab $->$ configure host slave $->$ Add vms to the slave, details in figure \ref{fig:vclvm}
    \item Add firewall rule in slave to allow traffic from masters public IP address.
    \begin{verbatim}
    root \$ iptables -I INPUT -s <master_public_ip>/32 \
    -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Add firewall rule in slave to allow traffic from masters private IP address.
    \begin{verbatim}
    root \$ iptables -I INPUT -s <master_private_ip>/32 \
    -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
    \end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

The steps mentioned above call a SQL procedure, which adds a virtual host in the management node's database \cite{sqlprocedure}.


\subsection{Extra Script Features}
The script provides a default option to configure a single VCL sandbox with OvS switch. It performs the following function:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Install packages required by OvS
    \item Fetch OvS tarball and install OvS
    \item Start the OvS service
    \item Add new OvS bridges for "nat" and "private" network
    \item Destroy and undefine the previous "nat" and "private" network configuration
    \item Define and load OvS "nat" and "private" network configuration
    \item Configures DHCP for "nat" and "private" network
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
root \$ ovs_vcl.py --default
\end{verbatim}

To-Do
\section{Verification and Validation}
%{The start up time for a host having Linux Bridges and Open v Switch bridges has not been validated. The reason is because we were provided with a pre booted up production machines to work on.}

%{Need to check the ping rate and external access to the VM}

    \newline
    Network address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in Internet Protocol (IP) datagram packet headers while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. The technique was originally used for ease of rerouting traffic in IP networks without readdressing every host.
    
    \item \textbf{Sandbox - Virtual Computing Lab Sandbox}
    \newline
    A VCL Sandbox is a mini-cloud image containing collection of several VMs pre-configured. It also houses VCL\textquotesingle s Management Node daemon that is responsible for provisioning these VMs.

\subsection{Apache Virtual Computing Lab} \label{apachevcl}
Apache VCL is an open-source implementation of a secure production-level on-demand services-oriented technology for wide-area access to solution based on real and virtualized resources, including computational, storage, networking, and software resources. It offers capabilities that are very flexible and diverse ranging from offering infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, software-as-a-service, also provides applications-as-a-service and more recently cloud-as-a-service and different combinations of those, to individual and group IT services, including HPC services.

The baseline service of VCL is provisiong of bare-metal and virtualized resources and extended services encompass PaaS and SaaS. VCL also allow users to install it and adapt it to their needs. A typical user accesses VCL through a Web interface, which after appropriate authentication and authorization steps, presents the user with a set of menu options. A number of additional VCL management functions are available for users with different levels of administrative privileges. In the Web interface, a user can select a particular environment of interest and request it of a given period of time. The image or image environment is loaded, for the duration requested, on either implicit automatically assisgned resources or on an explicit set of resources. VCL also has a network-oriented API that allows remote applications, middleware, and operating systems to access the same functionality through a publishable service. This allows automatic augmentation of end-user needs and seamless addition of resources provided the end-user platform is configured to do so.

\label{fig:vclarch}
\end{figure}

The top-level architecture of VCL is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:vclarch}. There are seven major groups of components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item end-user access interface
    \item authentication service
    \item VCL manager that manages user requests
    \item VCL database
    \item node manager that manages local installation resources and loads VCL images
    \item image repository
    \item computational, storage, and networking resources
\end{enumerate}

The VCL architecture abstracts resources at several levels: at the application and OS level via images and hypervisors, at the hardware location level (via VCL manager and nodes), and at the network level (via virtual networks, VLANs, VPNs).
